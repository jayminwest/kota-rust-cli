# KOTA Knowledge Base

This directory contains the KOTA knowledge base, which is automatically managed by the AI agent for storing and organizing conversation context, memory, and learned information.

## Structure

The knowledge base follows the KOTA organizational principles:

### Core Directories

- `core/` - Core system files for KOTA itself
  - `core/conversation/` - Conversation logs and notes
  - `core/knowledge-management/` - Knowledge system documentation
  - `core/partnership/` - Partnership dynamics documentation
  - `core/mcp/` - Model Context Protocol information

- `personal/` - Personal information, goals, and tracking
  - `personal/identity/` - User profile and cognitive information
  - `personal/journaling-tracking/weekly-notes/` - Weekly plans and reflections
  - `personal/career-finance/` - Career and financial planning

- `businesses/` - Business venture information
- `projects/` - Project documentation
  - `projects/active/` - Ongoing projects
- `systems/` - Reusable systems and frameworks
- `scripts/` - Utility scripts
- `data/` - Raw data storage
- `templates/` - Reusable document templates

## Features

- **Automatic Memory Storage**: KOTA automatically stores important conversation context and learned information
- **Structured Organization**: Files are organized by domain rather than type
- **Cross-referencing**: Links between related information using markdown links
- **Timestamping**: All entries include timestamps in (DD-MM-YY HH:MM) format
- **Privacy Protection**: Contents are local-only and not committed to git

## Usage

KOTA will automatically:
- Create and maintain the directory structure
- Store conversation summaries and important context
- Organize information by relevance and domain
- Update timestamps on modifications
- Provide easy access to stored knowledge during conversations

The knowledge base is designed to support distributed cognition and long-term memory for the KOTA-user partnership.
