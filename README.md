</p>

KOTA is an advanced interactive Rust CLI that provides both a sophisticated Terminal User Interface (TUI) and a classic command-line interface for AI-assisted code editing and development tasks. It integrates with multiple LLM providers and features comprehensive vim-style navigation, intelligent file editing, command execution, and context management capabilities.

## Philosophy: A Cognitive Partner in Code

KOTA is designed to be more than just a command-line tool ‚Äì it's a cognitive partner that augments your capabilities in software development and complex knowledge work. Built with the vision of becoming an increasingly autonomous AI agent, KOTA embodies several key principles:

### üöÄ Self-Improving System
KOTA has the unique ability to modify its own source code. When guided by users, it can iteratively enhance its capabilities, add new features, and evolve over time. This self-modification loop (supported by the `run_kota.sh` wrapper) represents a step toward truly adaptive software.

### üß† Deep Contextual Understanding
The tool excels at managing and utilizing context ‚Äì from your project files to its own source code and interaction history. Through its context management system, KOTA maintains awareness of what it's working on and can make informed, relevant suggestions.

### ü§ñ Intelligent Autonomy
While remaining user-directed, KOTA strives for increasing autonomy. It can break down complex tasks, execute multi-step operations, and leverage command outputs to make follow-up decisions ‚Äì all with appropriate user oversight.

### üõ°Ô∏è Safety & Control
Despite its autonomous capabilities, KOTA prioritizes user control and safety:
- **File Access Control**: Can only edit files explicitly added to its context
- **Confirmation Required**: All file changes and commands require user approval
- **Transparent Operations**: Shows exactly what it's doing and why

### ‚ö° Rapid Adaptability
In the fast-evolving AI landscape, KOTA is designed to adapt at the speed of innovation. Through its self-modification capabilities and modular architecture, it can quickly integrate new models, adopt emerging tools, and evolve its capabilities as the AI ecosystem advances. This ensures KOTA remains cutting-edge without requiring complete rewrites or architectural overhauls.

### üîÆ Future Vision
KOTA represents an exploration of distributed cognition ‚Äì where human and AI capabilities merge to create something more powerful than either alone. It's a step toward a future where AI partners can handle significant portions of complex work, allowing humans to focus on higher-level thinking and creativity.

  ```

## Installation

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd kota-rust-cli
cargo build --release
```

## Usage

### Start KOTA (TUI Mode - Default)
```bash
cargo run
```

The TUI provides an interactive multi-pane interface with professional layout and responsive design:

#### TUI Navigation
- **i** - Enter insert mode to type messages
- **Esc** - Return to normal mode
- **f** - Enter file browser mode
- **a** - Toggle auto-scroll mode in chat (AUTO/MANUAL indicator)
- **Tab** - Cycle through panes (Chat ‚Üí Terminal ‚Üí Context ‚Üí File Browser)
- **hjkl / ‚Üë‚Üì‚Üê‚Üí** - Navigate and scroll within panes
- **n/p** - Navigate through command suggestions (when terminal focused)
- **x** - Execute selected command or all commands
- **?** - Show help and keyboard shortcuts
- **Ctrl+Q** - Quit application

#### TUI Workflow
1. **Browse files**: Press 'f' to open file browser, navigate with hjkl, Enter to add files
2. **Chat with AI**: Press 'i' to enter insert mode, type your message, press Enter
3. **Execute commands**: AI suggestions appear in terminal pane, press Tab to focus, 'x' to execute
4. **Review changes**: File edits are applied with confirmation, auto-commits created

### Available Commands (Both TUI and CLI)

#### Context Management
- `/add_file <path>` - Add file contents to context
- `/add_snippet <text>` - Add text snippet to context  
- `/show_context` - Display current context
- `/clear_context` - Clear all context

### AI Interactions

Simply type natural language prompts to interact with the AI:

```
You: Add error handling to the main function
```

The AI can respond with:
1. **File edits** using Search/Replace blocks
2. **Commands** to build, test, or manage the project
3. **Explanations** and guidance
4. **Autonomous agent commands** (executed automatically)

### Example Workflows

#### TUI Workflow
1. **Start KOTA**: `cargo run` (launches TUI by default)
2. **Add files to context**: Press 'f', navigate to files, press Enter to add
3. **Send message**: Press 'i', type "Add better error handling", press Enter
4. **Execute commands**: AI suggestions appear in terminal, press Tab to focus terminal, 'x' to execute
5. **Review changes**: File edits are applied automatically after confirmation

#### Agent Delegation Workflow
```bash
# Ask AI to delegate a complex task
You: I need to refactor this codebase to use async/await patterns throughout

# AI responds with autonomous agent commands:
ü§ñ Executing autonomous AI commands:
‚Üí /agents
‚Üí /delegate refactor codebase to use async/await patterns
‚Üí /agent code_agent

# AI provides detailed plan and begins execution
```

#### Self-Modification Workflow
```bash
# Use the wrapper script for automatic rebuild/restart
./run_kota.sh

# Inside KOTA, ask it to improve itself
You: Add a new command /version that shows the current version of KOTA

# KOTA will:
# 1. Request to read its own source: /add_file src/main.rs
# 2. Generate S/R blocks to add the feature
# 3. Apply changes and create a commit
# 4. Exit with code 123 to trigger rebuild

# The wrapper script automatically rebuilds and restarts KOTA with new features!
```
